Rotary table stepper controller

What is FUCAN-Spintroller? Why, it's a CNC rotary table controller that doesn't take any G-Code whatsoever!

How about a 31T spur gear? No problem! Throw an involute gear cutter into your spindle, cut a blank disc and mount to a mandrel, chuck it into your 3 jaw, and enter "31" when it asks how many divisions to run. Run the X axis across the blank and hit cycle start! Rinse and repeat for a total of 6 times! Congrats! You now have a gear that you probably couldn't have bought off the shelf.

Want to make your own heptagon stock from round? No problem! Put your bar stock in the chuck on your RT, load up an endmill or slotdrill, and enter "7" when it asks you how many divisions to run. Run the X axis across, and hit cycle start! Rinse and repeat for a total of 7 times! Congrats! You now have some heptagon stock to make nuts that you can use to troll your friends!
